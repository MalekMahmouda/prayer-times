======================

Islamic desktop companion — prayer times, Quran, Dhikr, Qibla, calendar,
99 Names, prayer history & statistics, Ramadan mode, desktop widget.

Highlights
----------
- Native Windows installer (Program Files, per-machine)
- System tray with live next-prayer countdown
- Offline prayer calculations with 8 calculation methods + madhab option
- Fullscreen Adhan overlay with 6 muadhdhin choices and per-prayer profiles
- Bundled verified Quran text (Tanzil / Saheeh International) — reader,
  search and bookmarks work fully offline
- Prayer history and statistics (record-based, stored locally only)
- Multiple saved locations with timezone support
- Desktop mini widget and Mini Mode
- Backup & restore of all personal data (JSON)
- 8 built-in themes + custom theme builder
- English / Arabic with full RTL

What's new in ${version}
------------------------
Qibla
- Corrected the Qibla arrow: relative sensor data is no longer mistaken for
  true north (absolute orientation events and iOS compass headings only)
- Landscape/rotation no longer turns the arrow: heading is compensated by
  the screen orientation angle (portrait → landscape → portrait stays put)
- Signed turn semantics with strict sensor-value validation; the compass
  listener still never accumulates across page visits
- New diagnostic readout on the Qibla page: Qibla bearing / Device heading /
  Turn / Sensor — desktop shows the static bearing honestly (no fake compass)

Azan
- Fixed the Azan setting pipeline: one authoritative adhanEnabled switch is
  normalized once and persisted, so OFF stays OFF and ON stays ON after
  restarts (the earlier adhan:false state confusion)
- Stopped repeated identical configuration pushes (the config-update bursts
  seen in azan-debug.log); every real push is now logged with its trigger
- Fixed disabling the Adhan overlay also silencing the azan — the overlay
  toggle now controls visibility only; the adhan audio still plays
- Verified all six bundled mu'adhdhin recordings end-to-end (file, size,
  packaging and resolver), with fuller error details in azan-debug.log

Data & Privacy
--------------
All personal data (settings, history, bookmarks, locations, themes, dhikr
progress) is stored locally under %APPDATA%\\Prayer Times. Nothing is sent
anywhere. Uninstalling keeps your data; use Settings > Data Management to
export or import a backup at any time.

Notes
-----
- The Windows installer is code-signed. On machines that do not yet trust
  the certificate, Windows SmartScreen may still show a warning on first
  run; choose "More info" > "Run anyway" if you trust this build.

const CHECKLIST = `# Manual Test Checklist — Prayer Times ${version}

Run this on a clean Windows machine (or a fresh VM) if possible.

## Install
- [ ] Double-click ${exeName}; SmartScreen note: choose "More info" > "Run anyway"
- [ ] Choose install directory (default Program Files works)
- [ ] Optional desktop shortcut checkbox works
- [ ] Launch-after-install checkbox works
- [ ] App launches and tray icon appears

## First run
- [ ] Location configures (GPS or city search); prayer times appear
- [ ] Countdown ticks; next-prayer highlight correct
- [ ] Themes switch (try OLED + Sahara); Arabic toggle works with RTL

## Core features
- [ ] Quran reader loads a surah offline; search finds text; bookmark an ayah
- [ ] Dhikr counter and library persist counts
- [ ] Record today's prayers in Prayer Record; check Stats page
- [ ] Calendar shows the month; CSV export works
- [ ] Qibla bearing + distance displayed

## Reliability
- [ ] Close window -> still in tray -> tray Open restores, tray Quit exits
- [ ] Launch app twice -> single instance (existing window focused)
- [ ] Widget toggle: always-on-top, draggable, correct prayer, closes
- [ ] Mini Mode: expand returns full window; no duplicate notifications
- [ ] Enable "Start with Windows", reboot Windows -> app auto-starts (tray)
- [ ] Disable "Start with Windows" -> no longer auto-starts
- [ ] Offline: disconnect network -> calculations, Quran, history all still work

## Data lifecycle
- [ ] Uninstall -> app removed, shortcuts removed
- [ ] Reinstall -> previous history/bookmarks/locations/themes still present
- [ ] Upgrade install over existing version -> data intact, no duplicates
